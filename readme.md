# Carbon Intensity xbar Plugin

What if you could reduce your electricity carbon footprint by 20-50% or more without spending a dime?  This free [xbar plugin](https://xbarapp.com/) shows real-time carbon intensity and cleanliness data for your local grid in your menu bar.  The purpose is to help you make real-time decisions about when to run electricity-intensive tasks (laundry, HVAC, EV charging, etc.) to minimize your carbon footprint.

In some parts of the country, the grid may be up to [80% dirtier](https://github.com/jasonm-jones/grid-carbon-intensity/blob/main/README.md) than other times in the same day.  Let's look at a couple examples.  The **average** day in May in Pacificorp East (Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, etc) varies 80%.  Individual days can vary even more than that.  On June 18, 2023 at noon the sun was shining and the carbon intensity was only 282 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh.  By 8pm the carbon intensity had spiked to 702 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh.   If you were to charge your EV for 1 hour at 10kWh, you would emit 2,820 gCO‚ÇÇ.  If you were to charge your EV at 8pm, you would emit 7,020 gCO‚ÇÇ.  Your carbon footprint would have been 2.5 times higher if you charged your EV at 8pm instead of noon.  More data andinsights [here](https://github.com/jasonm-jones/grid-carbon-intensity/blob/main/README.md).

## Understanding the Display

The plugin shows several key metrics:
- **Menu Bar**: Shows the current grid cleanliness emoji, percentile, and carbon intensity
- **Graph**: Shows the last 24 hours of carbon intensity relative to the average
  - Red Bars above the center line indicate dirtier than average periods
  - Green Bars below the center line indicate cleaner than average periods
  - Colors indicate relative cleanliness (green = clean, red = dirty)
  - A vertical dashed line marks the current time ("Now")
- **Relative Emissions** (%): How clean the grid is compared to the last 24 hours
- **Carbon Intensity** (gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh): The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity used (lower is better)
- **Power Breakdown**: Percentage of power from each source (renewables and fossil fuels)

### Grid Cleanliness Indicators

The emoji shows how clean your grid electricity is right now **relative to the last 24 hours**:

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| üåø | Relatively Clean - Top 20% cleanest kW's of the last 24 hours |
| üå± | Cleaner than Average - 60-80th percentile |
| üòë | Average Conditions - 40-60th percentile |
| üò° | Dirtier than Average - 20-40th percentile |
| ‚õî | Very Dirty - Bottom 20% |
| ‚ùì | Data Unavailable |

For example:
- "üåø (23%) 245 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh" means the grid cleanliness is in the 23rd percentile (top 77% cleanest) relative to the last 24 hours
- "‚õî (85%) 450 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh" means the grid cleanliness is in the 85th percentile (bottom 15% dirtiest) relative to the last 24 hours

This can help you decide when to run energy-intensive tasks for minimum environmental impact.

## Installation

1. Install [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/) (macOS only)
2. Open xbar and click "Browse Plugins"
3. Search for "Carbon Intensity" in the Environment category
   - If not found, you can manually copy the plugin from [carbon-intensity.15m.js](https://github.com/jasonm-jones/carbon-intensity-xbar/blob/main/carbon-intensity.15m.js) to your xbar plugins directory (typically at `~/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins/`)
4. Click "Install"
5. Install required dependencies using either option:

   **Option 1 - Using Homebrew (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   # Install system dependencies
   brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib
   
   # Install npm packages
   npm install canvas
   ```

   **Option 2 - Using MacPorts**:
   ```bash
   # Install system dependencies
   sudo port install pkgconfig cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib
   
   # Install npm packages
   npm install canvas
   ```

6. Configure your API keys and zones (see Configuration below)
7. Refresh xbar

## Configuration

1. Get your API credentials:
   - Get an [Electricity Maps API key](https://api-portal.electricitymaps.com/signup)

2. Find your zone information (see Zones section below)

3. Configure the plugin:
   - Create a new file in the xbar plugins directory called `carbon-intensity.15m.js.vars.json`
     (typically at `~/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins/carbon-intensity.15m.js.vars.json`)
   - Copy this template and replace with your values:
     ```json
     {
       "ELECTRICITY_MAPS_API_KEY": "your-electricity-maps-api-key-here",
       "ELECTRICITY_MAPS_ZONE": "your-electricity-maps-zone-here"
     }
     ```

Note: The `.vars.json` file contains your API key and should not be shared or committed to version control.

## Zones
