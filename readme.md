# Carbon Intensity xbar Plugin

Shows real-time carbon intensity and grid cleanliness data in your menu bar.  The purpose is to help you make real-time decisions about when to run energy-intensive tasks (EV charging, laundry, etc.) to minimize your carbon footprint.  In some parts of the country, the grid may be up to 60% dirtier than other times in the same day.

## Understanding the Display

The plugin shows several key metrics:
- **Carbon Intensity** (gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh): The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity used
- **24hr Relative Cleanliness** (%): How clean the grid is compared to the next 24 hours
- **Power Source Breakdown**: Percentage of power from renewable and fossil fuel sources

### Grid Cleanliness Indicators

The emoji shows how clean your electricity is right now relative to the next 24 hours:

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| üåø | Extremely Clean - Among the cleanest 20% of times |
| üå± | Cleaner than Average |
| üòë | Average Conditions |
| üò´ | Dirtier than Average |
| üò° | Very Dirty |
| ‚õî | Extremely Dirty |
| ‚ùì | Data Unavailable |

For example:
- "üåø (77%) 245 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh" means the grid cleanliness is in the top 77th percentile relative to the next 24 hours
- "‚õî (15%) 450 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh" means the grid cleanliness is in the bottom 15th percentile relative to the next 24 hours

This can help you decide when to run energy-intensive tasks for minimum environmental impact.

## Installation

1. Install [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/)
2. Open xbar and click "Browse Plugins"
3. Search for "Carbon Intensity"
4. Click "Install"
5. Configure your API keys and zones (see Configuration below)
6. Refresh xbar

## Configuration

1. Get your API credentials:
   - Get an [Electricity Maps API key](https://api-portal.electricitymaps.com/signup)
   - Sign up for [WattTime API access](https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#register-new-user)

2. Find your zone information (see Zones section below)

3. Configure the plugin:
   - Create a new file in the xbar plugins directory called `carbon-intensity.1h.js.vars.json`
   - Copy this template and replace with your values:
     ```json
     {
       "ELECTRICITY_MAPS_API_KEY": "your-electricity-maps-api-key-here",
       "ELECTRICITY_MAPS_ZONE": "your-electricity-maps-zone-here",
       "WATTTIME_USERNAME": "your-watt-time-username-here",
       "WATTTIME_PASSWORD": "your-watt-time-password-here",
       "WATTTIME_ZONE": "your-watt-time-zone-here"
     }
     ```

Note: The `.vars.json` file contains your API keys and should not be shared or committed to version control.
