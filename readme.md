# Carbon Intensity xbar Plugin

Shows real-time carbon intensity and grid cleanliness data in your menu bar.

## Understanding the Display

The plugin shows two key metrics:
- **Carbon Intensity** (gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh): The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of electricity
- **Grid Cleanliness Percentile** (%): How clean the grid is compared to typical conditions

### Grid Cleanliness Indicators

The emoji shows how clean your electricity is right now compared to typical conditions:

| Emoji | Percentile | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| üå± | 0-20% | Extremely Clean - Among the cleanest 20% of times |
| üåø | 21-40% | Cleaner than Average |
| üçÇ | 41-60% | Average Conditions |
| üí® | 61-80% | Dirtier than Average |
| üè≠ | 81-90% | Very Dirty |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | 91-100% | Extremely Dirty - Among the dirtiest 10% of times |

For example:
- "üå± 245 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh (23%)" means the grid is cleaner than 77% of typical conditions
- "üè≠ 450 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh (85%)" means the grid is dirtier than 85% of typical conditions

This can help you decide when to run energy-intensive tasks for minimum environmental impact.
