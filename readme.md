# Carbon Intensity xbar Plugin

What if you could reduce your electricity carbon footprint by 20-50% or more without spending a dime?  This free [xbar plugin](https://xbarapp.com/) shows real-time carbon intensity and cleanliness data for your local grid in your menu bar.  The purpose is to help you make real-time decisions about when to run electricity-intensive tasks (laundry, HVAC, EV charging, etc.) to minimize your carbon footprint. In some parts of the country, the grid may be up to [80% dirtier](https://github.com/jasonm-jones/grid-carbon-intensity/blob/main/README.md) than other times in the same day.

## Understanding the Display

The plugin shows several key metrics:
- **Relative Cleanliness** (%): How clean the grid is compared to the last 24 hours
- **Carbon Intensity** (gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh): The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity used
- **Current Power Breakdown**: Percentage of power from renewable and fossil fuel sources

### Grid Cleanliness Indicators

The emoji shows how clean your grid electricity is right now **relative to the last 24 hours**:

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| üåø | Relatively Clean - Top 20% cleanest kW's of the last 24 hours |
| üå± | Cleaner than Average - 60-80th percentile |
| üòë | Average Conditions - 40-60th percentile |
| üò° | Dirtier than Average - 20-40th percentile |
| ‚õî | Very Dirty - Bottom 20% |
| ‚ùì | Data Unavailable |

For example:
- "üåø (77%) 245 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh" means the grid cleanliness is in the 77th percentile (top 23% cleanest) relative to the last 24 hours
- "‚õî (15%) 450 gCO‚ÇÇeq/kWh" means the grid cleanliness is in the 15th percentile (bottom 85% dirtiest) relative to the last 24 hours

This can help you decide when to run energy-intensive tasks for minimum environmental impact.

## Installation

1. Install [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/)
2. Open xbar and click "Browse Plugins"
3. Search for "Carbon Intensity"
4. Click "Install"
5. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install system dependencies (macOS)
   brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib
   
   # Install npm packages
   npm install canvas
   ```
6. Configure your API keys and zones (see Configuration below)
7. Refresh xbar

## Configuration

1. Get your API credentials:
   - Get an [Electricity Maps API key](https://api-portal.electricitymaps.com/signup)

2. Find your zone information (see Zones section below)

3. Configure the plugin:
   - Create a new file in the xbar plugins directory called `carbon-intensity.1h.js.vars.json`
     (typically at `~/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins/carbon-intensity.1h.js.vars.json`)
   - Copy this template and replace with your values:
     ```json
     {
       "ELECTRICITY_MAPS_API_KEY": "your-electricity-maps-api-key-here",
       "ELECTRICITY_MAPS_ZONE": "your-electricity-maps-zone-here"
     }
     ```

Note: The `.vars.json` file contains your API key and should not be shared or committed to version control.

## Zones
Common zones for US regions:

| Region | Electricity Maps |
|--------|-----------------|
